# Clinica las Retamas web implementation
 -- WORK IN PROGRESS -- 
Update of the first web page I developed. In this case, I will use the same visual assets (mainly maintaining structure as a whole) but trying to optimize and reshape as much as it is possible.

Also, one of the main motivations is to update the web page to an up-to-date framework for easiness of debugging, reproductibility and expansion.
